For some, that means the kiddos return to the classroom full-time. But it also means lunches, laundry and schoolwork will be in full swing at home. Our collection of studies, pocket offices and gamerooms make ideal homework stations, and our foyers and family ready rooms help parents keep lunches, laundry and schedules in order.\n\n#### A+ Space: The Family Ready Room\n\nTypically located off of the garage and the kitchen, the family ready room is so much more than a laundry room. Think of this as an A+ space to help you get your family ready and out the door.\n\nThe options for this must-have space are virtually endless. Equip your family ready room with a sink and refrigerator to house those after-school snacks. Cabinets provide countless opportunities for storage, and ample counter space makes it easy to get laundry in order.\n\n![laundry room with dog wash and refridgerator](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/49035b12-a11b-4d26-899c-56feefc3844b/STCK-0118_Belvidere-C_Family-Ready-Room-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nDid we mention that options are nearly endless? The family ready room isn’t just for laundry and out-the-door prep. Outfit this space with a small pocket office and create a designated spot for homework and crafts. Drees Architecture Designer Paige Foss said these types of multi-functional spaces are among the home design philosophies that are expected to become increasingly popular.\n\n#### A+ Space: The Functional Foyer\n\nFamily foyers are the organizational hubs of the home. Here is the perfect spot to hang your calendars and white boards to keep everyone’s schedule straight. Beyond helping with the mental housekeeping, these spaces provide seamless storage. The bench and hooks adjacent to the door means that backpacks and jackets will no longer be strewn across the floor. A parenting win!\n\n![foyer with bench, coat hooks and cubbies](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/1237d614-a348-460b-a13e-d8134003a717/ANN1-0116-00_Wilshire_B_Family-Foyer-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### A+ Space: The Versatile Gameroom\n\nYes, gamerooms are for both work and play. Gamerooms, although not as private as a study, are so versatile they can be designed as the ultimate schoolwork stations. This spot in the home is ideal for families who have more than one school-aged child. Configure lounge chairs and couches so the kids can get comfortable while they do their homework.\n\n![new home gameroom with accent wall](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/e07c4cff-ec96-4224-a1da-e77ba78011f3/HPH6-0119-00_Marshall-D_Game-Room-01-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nGamerooms easily inspire creativity and collaboration. Fun and relaxation are usually the first things that come to mind when we think gamerooms, but these rooms can also serve as functional workspaces.\n\n![gameroom with adjoining media room](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/8bbc67f9-fdf6-4e98-84c4-a68f5e296f2c/LTBY-0049-00_Marabelle_B_Gameroom-1-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### A+ Space: The Spacious Study\n\nPerfect for middle schoolers, high schoolers (and for parents, let’s be honest), our spacious studies are typically secluded from other spaces in the home. Whether you prefer sophisticated or minimal design, there’s one thing that is common across the study: These spaces optimize focus and eliminate distractions. The study has always held its own in home design, but demand has skyrocketed in recent years.\n\n![home office with french doors](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/94dccb12-e055-4201-b863-acbdf64a626b/STCK-0118_Belvidere-C_Home-Office-2-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### A+ Space: The Practical Pocket Office\n\nDon’t want to devote a whole room to a study? No problem – there are pocket offices for that! These spaces are perfect for the multitaskers. Pocket offices allow parents to help the little ones with schoolwork while keeping a pulse on the rest of the home, so you can do dinner and multiplication tables at the same time. Pocket offices, which are usually adjacent to the kitchen, weave in a lot of functionality in just a little pocket of space, making them the unsung hero of homework time.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.dreeshomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LTBY-0049-00_Marabelle_B_Bedroom-4c-1-1024x683.jpg?ssl=1)\n\n![desk and cabinets off kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/e3b2e184-8c65-4c20-a08e-b5fcdbb36e9e/ANN1-0116-00_Wilshire_B_Pantry-1-jpg)\n\n![pocket office off the kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/43d28a79-c8df-470c-9799-c73d4d6f37c1/HRMA-0249d_Breck_office-tiff)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Ready to start designing your dream home?\n\nFrom [Instagram inspiration](https://www.instagram.com/dreeshomes/?hl=en) and [Pinterest pins](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/_saved/) to your final floor plan, Drees makes it easy to bring it all together.

For some, that means the kiddos return to the classroom full-time. But it also means lunches, laundry and schoolwork will be in full swing at home. Our collection of studies, pocket offices and gamerooms make ideal homework stations, and our foyers and family ready rooms help parents keep lunches, laundry and schedules in order.\n\n#### A+ Space: The Family Ready Room\n\nTypically located off of the garage and the kitchen, the family ready room is so much more than a laundry room. Think of this as an A+ space to help you get your family ready and out the door.\n\nThe options for this must-have space are virtually endless. Equip your family ready room with a sink and refrigerator to house those after-school snacks. Cabinets provide countless opportunities for storage, and ample counter space makes it easy to get laundry in order.\n\n![laundry room with dog wash and refridgerator](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/49035b12-a11b-4d26-899c-56feefc3844b/STCK-0118_Belvidere-C_Family-Ready-Room-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nDid we mention that options are nearly endless? The family ready room isn’t just for laundry and out-the-door prep. Outfit this space with a small pocket office and create a designated spot for homework and crafts. Drees Architecture Designer Paige Foss said these types of multi-functional spaces are among the home design philosophies that are expected to become increasingly popular.\n\n#### A+ Space: The Functional Foyer\n\nFamily foyers are the organizational hubs of the home. Here is the perfect spot to hang your calendars and white boards to keep everyone’s schedule straight. Beyond helping with the mental housekeeping, these spaces provide seamless storage. The bench and hooks adjacent to the door means that backpacks and jackets will no longer be strewn across the floor. A parenting win!\n\n![foyer with bench, coat hooks and cubbies](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/1237d614-a348-460b-a13e-d8134003a717/ANN1-0116-00_Wilshire_B_Family-Foyer-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### A+ Space: The Versatile Gameroom\n\nYes, gamerooms are for both work and play. Gamerooms, although not as private as a study, are so versatile they can be designed as the ultimate schoolwork stations. This spot in the home is ideal for families who have more than one school-aged child. Configure lounge chairs and couches so the kids can get comfortable while they do their homework.\n\n![new home gameroom with accent wall](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/e07c4cff-ec96-4224-a1da-e77ba78011f3/HPH6-0119-00_Marshall-D_Game-Room-01-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nGamerooms easily inspire creativity and collaboration. Fun and relaxation are usually the first things that come to mind when we think gamerooms, but these rooms can also serve as functional workspaces.\n\n![gameroom with adjoining media room](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/8bbc67f9-fdf6-4e98-84c4-a68f5e296f2c/LTBY-0049-00_Marabelle_B_Gameroom-1-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### A+ Space: The Spacious Study\n\nPerfect for middle schoolers, high schoolers (and for parents, let’s be honest), our spacious studies are typically secluded from other spaces in the home. Whether you prefer sophisticated or minimal design, there’s one thing that is common across the study: These spaces optimize focus and eliminate distractions. The study has always held its own in home design, but demand has skyrocketed in recent years.\n\n![home office with french doors](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/94dccb12-e055-4201-b863-acbdf64a626b/STCK-0118_Belvidere-C_Home-Office-2-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### A+ Space: The Practical Pocket Office\n\nDon’t want to devote a whole room to a study? No problem – there are pocket offices for that! These spaces are perfect for the multitaskers. Pocket offices allow parents to help the little ones with schoolwork while keeping a pulse on the rest of the home, so you can do dinner and multiplication tables at the same time. Pocket offices, which are usually adjacent to the kitchen, weave in a lot of functionality in just a little pocket of space, making them the unsung hero of homework time.\n\n![](https://i0.wp.com/blog.dreeshomes.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/LTBY-0049-00_Marabelle_B_Bedroom-4c-1-1024x683.jpg?ssl=1)\n\n![desk and cabinets off kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/e3b2e184-8c65-4c20-a08e-b5fcdbb36e9e/ANN1-0116-00_Wilshire_B_Pantry-1-jpg)\n\n![pocket office off the kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/43d28a79-c8df-470c-9799-c73d4d6f37c1/HRMA-0249d_Breck_office-tiff)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Ready to start designing your dream home?\n\nFrom [Instagram inspiration](https://www.instagram.com/dreeshomes/?hl=en) and [Pinterest pins](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/_saved/) to your final floor plan, Drees makes it easy to bring it all together.

With that in mind, our collection of outdoor living spaces and kitchens are perfect for hosting a red, white and blue summer soiree.\n\n![A beautiful patriotic USA table setting for a 4th of July celebration](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/38463de1-7e10-4c22-b727-3b5497913f70/ONESTYLISHPARTYJULY-119-jpg)![A beautiful patriotic USA table setting for a 4th of July celebration](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/e38f1cf0-86e6-4c35-8f7d-690dbf60a128/ONESTYLISHPARTYJULY-126-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n[Drees homebuyer Tara Berger](https://www.instagram.com/onestylishparty/) from the entertaining resource [One Stylish Party](https://www.facebook.com/onestylishparty/) provided us with the perfect patriotic inspiration.\n\nWhat better spot to host a cookout than in a [stunning outdoor living space.](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/outdoor-living-design/) Many of our floor plans feature spacious outdoor living areas that are ideal for a cookout. Outfit this space with a dining table, and your guests can take in serene views while they eat.

And no worries if the party continues into the night – simply light the fireplace for instant warmth and comfort.

Perhaps it’s better to not compete with the space itself, but to use decorations to compliment its selections.\n\n![A gorgeous custom kitchen with beautiful patriotic decorations for the 4th of July](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/7bff736d-dbac-4cff-aafc-172172d10437/ONESTYLISHPARTYJULY-51-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n### Ready to start designing your dream home?\n\nFrom [Instagram inspiration](https://www.instagram.com/dreeshomes/?hl=en) and [Pinterest pins](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/_saved/) to your final floor plan, Drees makes it easy to bring it all together.

While they loved the house they lived in for 13 years, they needed more room to stretch and grow. With two growing girls, two growing dogs and working from home, their current home was no longer cutting it. Although, they couldn't find the perfect match on the market. Husband Nate shared, \"Either the house was not the right size or needed numerous updates. We didn't want the headache of renovating a house after moving in or sacrificing more space that we desperately needed. Building new was the ultimate answer.\"\n\nThe Engel family set out to build their dream home, and along the way, decided to document their journey on Instagram ( [@ourgreenhouse\\_onthehill](https://www.instagram.com/ourgreenhouse_onthehill/)). Daughters Harper and Amelia served as hostesses throughout the documentation journey.\n\nTo shed more light on their journey, Nate and Kalynn sat down to share insights into their custom home building process.\n\n﻿\n\n#### What floor plan did you choose and what attracted you to this design?\n\n_We chose the [Alden](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/4dc1ecc90ffc495eb547c7aca604170f.aspx)_ _because we fell in love with the two-story fireplace, the open kitchen and the living area and the extra game room space that is a perfect handout for our girls and their friends._\n\n#### As you have watched your new home’s design come to life, what have been your favorite features?\n\n_We love catching sunsets off of our covered deck, and the green tile backsplash in the kitchen is a great conversation piece._\n\n![New homeowners in the Alden kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/81c34d7c-cb2c-406b-a495-0c3090655975/SBSM-0316-00_Alden_EngelFamily_19-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### What did you enjoy most about the building process?\n\n_We had so much fun choosing finishes at the Design Center and then watching them come together in real life. We were fortunate to live close to where we built so we could visit nearly every day to see the progress._\n\n#### What advice would you give others who are interested in building a home?\n\n_Ask questions! If there’s a design choice or feature you’ve admired in other homes, bring it to the table. Also, visit as many model homes as you can to get a feel for the finishes in real life._\n\n![New homeowners outside of their Alden home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/44ebf6bd-e3e8-413a-98c3-ab8a29a14e6e/SBSM-0316-00_Alden_EngelFamily_10-jpg)![New homeowners outside of their Alden home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/2bc3a21b-c3ed-4be2-917a-f5f2746591d5/SBSM-0316-00_Alden_EngelFamily_08-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Why did you choose to build with Drees?\n\n_We walked through a model home after house hunting for two years. All the finishes and features were exactly what we were looking for, but it was the **[Market Manager Holly Anderson](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/b6cabd1e9c4b4718bb63053af6c03c2a.aspx)**who sold us on [Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/fee07e862d054c23a4ec86760960ba1c.aspx) and the neighborhood. If she hadn't been in that model when we walked in, I don't think we would have landed here today._\n\n#### Learn More\n\nTo learn more about building your own new home with Drees Homes, click [here](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/35e008bfdfc24f39986e6ad1e39aa9bb.aspx).

living all on one level. You'll love entertaining in the open family room with optional fireplace, kitchen with generous island and dining area. Retreat to the spacious primary suite, where you'll find a private bath and large walk-in closet. Keep your personal items organized and out of sight in the family foyer and laundry room, located just inside the garage entry into the home. Two secondary bedrooms and a full bath can be found just off the main foyer. And you can choose from a variety of upgrades to make the Kenai suit your personal style, such a sunroom, optional covered outdoor living area, a home office in lieu of bedroom #3, and a \"super shower\" upgrade in the primary suite bath. If you need more living space, you can add a second floor gameroom, bedroom and full bath. Plus, you can add a lower level with a rec room, den, and bath, providing ample space for relaxing with friends and family.\n\n![Grandmother and granddaughter enjoying new home front porch](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/176fa749-51b5-4355-8e77-0c8945e371b4/GettyImages-164853471-jpg)\n\n#### Floor Plan Features\n\n- One-level living with three bedrooms; opt for a second story for an additional bedroom and hobby / gameroom\n- Kitchen has great sightlines of the dining room, family room and the back yard; optional outdoor living extends your entertainment zone\n- Private home office can be selected in lieu of a bedroom\n\n### Explore this Floor Plan\n\n[Download Brochure](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/4d29071531f9bdf6/original/B260515-OHCN_Kenai-pdf.pdf) [Customize Your Floor Plan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/interactive/new-homes-cincinnati-northern-kentucky/kenai-floorplan) [Browse Design Choices](https://edc2.envisionoptions.com/org-4000825/presales/plan-8348630/home/index)\n\nMain LevelOptional Lower Level\n\n![Main Level](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/e69c4f3a83d4d5e/original/Kenai_0FLR1-svg.svg)\n\nReset\n\n### Where We Build This Plan\n\n1. 1. ![community entrance with stone monument](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/2c854512-c302-413b-9dc2-92cee755ad7c/southwick2022__30A5506-tif)\n\n2. ![Custom two-story home with front entry garage](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/777ca3ff-dc7b-470a-a8e9-e0a96dac7c01/SWKV-0001-00_Sarasota_Exterior-tif)\n\n3. ![family room with vaulted ceiling](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/438b59cf-2e61-4526-95c5-7e18415b933e/SWKV-0001-00_Sarasota_Family-Room-01-tif)\n\n4. ![community walking path](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/7c245067-df26-46c0-96a3-42b3843d4c02/southwick2022__30A5533-tif)\n\n5. ![Primary Suite with wall of windows](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/d7e73799-f97e-4661-b9f6-c7cdc114a23f/HPH-0203-00-Sarasota-D_Primary-Suite-tif)\n\n6. ![Primary Suite with wall of windows](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/d7e73799-f97e-4661-b9f6-c7cdc114a23f/HPH-0203-00-Sarasota-D_Primary-Suite-tif)\n\nView more details\n\n\n![Previous Arrow](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\n![Next Arrow](<Base64-Image-Removed>)\n\nItem 1 of 6\n\nLow Maintenance Living \\| Nature Trails\n\n##### Southwick - The Villas\n\nPatio Home in Erlanger, KY 41018\n\n1,320 - 2,336Sq.

We’ve partnered with the couple to take us along on their home building journey. Now that they’ve fully settled in, they’re sharing how they kick off the holiday season - from trimming the tree to entertaining.\n\n### Prioritizing a stress-free holiday\n\n_By David and Edward Guerra_\n\n![The Midwest husbands home decorated for the holidays](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4ce89329-1ebe-496f-8c20-646086b84ecd/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-11-jpeg)![The Midwest Husbands' dog in the family room](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/884dde3e-24cf-47dc-b8db-6a433c612388/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-13-jpeg)\n\n﻿\n\nLet’s do more with less. There is enough pressure this season with all the activities, events, hosting and the end of the year. There is no need to feel rushed from early decorating and trends. Enjoy the process and journey of making it yours, and bring out things from the past. After all, what’s old is new again!\n\n![custom home of the Midwest Husbands](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/5da2a5f0-d429-44e2-af8b-065c55c8ff35/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-10-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nWe’ll admit that we’re usually early to put our decorations up, but this year, we’re late (for our standards) and still feeling good about it! And if you have a real tree, that’s how it is!\n\nMake festive and simple ornaments or garlands with citrus, cinnamon, and twine. Involve family and friends or have some solo time here. We especially love the fall colors and keeping those in our home through the holidays with oranges, golds, and burgundies mixing in with the evergreen boughs.\n\n![The Midwest husbands home decorated for the holidays](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/87738168-88e8-4c41-8cd1-5a1b16e3e98b/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-05-jpg)![The Midwest husbands home decorated for the holidays](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/e47ea1c3-a44c-4a9d-9cac-d3ba8d682f0b/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-07-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nDo you end up fighting with the twinkle lights every year? We find weaving the strings over and under branches keeps them in place. Be sure to bring the strands closer to the tips as well. Use decorative cord-wrapped wire ties or dark-colored zip ties when hanging evergreen on stairs!\n\n![The Midwest husbands home decorated for the holidays](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/357f3656-120d-40f8-babb-06428a207a9b/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-02-jpg)![The Midwest husbands home decorated for the holidays](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/26cc7551-94f5-495b-bd60-ecca6453dec6/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-04-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nLastly, when having guests over, remember that store-bought is fine! There are so many good options for prepared foods; there is nothing wrong with warming it up in the oven, air-fryer or microwave. Serve it on a platter, and no one will even know (unless you tell them, they will likely be thrilled because they can enjoy the same meal or treat later with their own crew)!\n\n![The gorgeous custom kitchen of the Midwest Husbands](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/e8c21e29-3b7f-48b7-b57f-a5180f5cf39e/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-08-jpg)![The gorgeous custom kitchen of the Midwest Husbands](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/b767a3e8-15d2-46bb-992f-7b769307fba9/WEX-0007-00_MonticelloA_MidwestHusbands_Holiday-09-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n### About the Midwest Husbands\n\n﻿\n\nDavid and Edward Guerra are a dynamic husband-husband duo who share their journey of growing into [their New England Colonial home](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/8942a775d6e348d4ac954328639ee7a6.aspx \"https://www.dreeshomes.com/blogs/the-midwest-husbands-post-closing-tips-for-making-your-drees-home-uniquely-yours/\").

While they loved the house they lived in for 13 years, they needed more room to stretch and grow. With two growing girls, two growing dogs and working from home, their current home was no longer cutting it. Although, they couldn't find the perfect match on the market. Husband Nate shared, \"Either the house was not the right size or needed numerous updates. We didn't want the headache of renovating a house after moving in or sacrificing more space that we desperately needed. Building new was the ultimate answer.\"\n\nThe Engel family set out to build their dream home, and along the way, decided to document their journey on Instagram ( [@ourgreenhouse\\_onthehill](https://www.instagram.com/ourgreenhouse_onthehill/)). Daughters Harper and Amelia served as hostesses throughout the documentation journey.\n\nTo shed more light on their journey, Nate and Kalynn sat down to share insights into their home building process.\n\n﻿\n\n#### What floor plan did you choose and what attracted you to this design?\n\n_We chose the [Alden](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/4dc1ecc90ffc495eb547c7aca604170f.aspx)_ _because we fell in love with the two-story fireplace, the open kitchen and the living area and the extra game room space that is a perfect handout for our girls and their friends._\n\n#### As you have watched your new home’s design come to life, what have been your favorite features?\n\n_We love catching sunsets off of our covered deck, and the green tile backsplash in the kitchen is a great conversation piece._\n\n![New homeowners in the Alden kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/81c34d7c-cb2c-406b-a495-0c3090655975/SBSM-0316-00_Alden_EngelFamily_19-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### What did you enjoy most about the building process?\n\n_We had so much fun choosing finishes at the Design Center and then watching them come together in real life. We were fortunate to live close to where we built so we could visit nearly every day to see the progress._\n\n#### What advice would you give others who are interested in building a home?\n\n_Ask questions! If there’s a design choice or feature you’ve admired in other homes, bring it to the table. Also, visit as many model homes as you can to get a feel for the finishes in real life._\n\n![New homeowners outside of their Alden home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/44ebf6bd-e3e8-413a-98c3-ab8a29a14e6e/SBSM-0316-00_Alden_EngelFamily_10-jpg)![New homeowners outside of their Alden home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/2bc3a21b-c3ed-4be2-917a-f5f2746591d5/SBSM-0316-00_Alden_EngelFamily_08-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Why did you choose to build with Drees?\n\n_We walked through a model home after house hunting for two years. All the finishes and features were exactly what we were looking for, but it was Market Manager Holly Andersonwho sold us on [Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/fee07e862d054c23a4ec86760960ba1c.aspx) and the neighborhood. If she hadn't been in that model when we walked in, I don't think we would have landed here today._\n\nStep right in and see how their dream home came to life by watching the video below:\n\n![media-item-block-image](https://vumbnail.com/1088876022.jpg)\n\nHomeowner Spotlight - Meet the Engel Family from Drees Homes on Vimeo\n\n![video thumbnail](https://i.vimeocdn.com/video/2021197534-a59a971aff8f7972e79f3461b4a1327598bcb3c47e97b4da50d5278e98448098-d?mw=80&q=85)\n\nPlaying in picture-in-picture\n\nUnmute\n\n# More options\n\nPause\n\nShow controls\n\nSettings\n\n# Settings\n\nQuality2K\n\n﻿\n\n#### Learn More\n\nDreaming of your own Drees home?

They had purchased their own land with the goal to eventually build on it. Their previous home was set on several acres, and they had grown to love having the extra space.\n\nThat's where the [Elevate by Drees Homes](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/902e7c2a371d4760aa070779ecf6092c.aspx?view=floorplans) team came in. Through this Build on Your Lot program, Drees empowers homebuyers to move beyond traditional subdivisions, constructing their dream homes on cherished land, within upscale custom communities or in historic neighborhoods. [Elevate by Drees Homes](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/902e7c2a371d4760aa070779ecf6092c.aspx?view=floorplans) allows homeowners to elevate their home building experience, whether they desire five acres, a custom community or rebuilding on an existing site.\n\nNatalie Hollander explained, \"The flexibility that Drees Homes provided throughout our build on your lot journey cannot be overstated. We loved making tweaks that we knew would fit us better based on previous builds. We truly feel like we got it exactly as we wanted this time.\"\n\nJake and Natalie sat down to share insights into their home building journey.\n\n﻿\n\n#### What floor plan did you choose and what attracted you to this design?\n\nWe chose the [Buchanan floor plan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/custom-homes/indianapolis/build-on-your-lot/buchanan/) because it offered several options we were wanting in our new home. We were first drawn to the exterior that is shown on the local model home, but quickly realized the interior options had exactly what we wanted as well. The ability to have four large bedrooms upstairs as a family of five was very important to us. We also made changes to the kitchen, great room and sunroom areas to allow for a more open layout to better fit our lifestyle.\n\n![New homeowners enjoying their new Drees Home kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/5c289af0-d0c7-46d8-a18b-6e9742aba1f4/IGA_0555-00_Hollander_0076-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### As you have watched your new home’s design come to life, what have been your favorite features?\n\nWe really enjoyed seeing the first floor kitchen/great room/sunroom area come to life. Fortunately, Drees was able to accommodate [a few floor plan modifications](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/c0dd7b4ef0394976a2f84a0f0a702f3e.aspx) that really turned the [Buchanan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/7cad8cb4cfff4bf589769a49badee9d7.aspx) into our own. We decided to enlarge and rotate the kitchen island so that it faces the sunroom, which is a feature I think I enjoy most in our home.\n\n#### What did you enjoy most about the building process?\n\nThe [Design appointments](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/613eaed8cff440669c1e7413188f5845.aspx) and the structure of [the build phases](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f4d7d3220dee43059d13b381b6f24e35.aspx). It was exciting to see what felt like [endless options, colors and styles to choose from](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/613eaed8cff440669c1e7413188f5845.aspx#room-gallery). I loved having the ability to really make our home our own based on color choices. We had previously built a custom home and struggled with the lack of process and what felt like a lot of last minute decisions. We truly appreciate the standard process and knowing what to expect throughout.\n\n![New homeowners in front of their Drees home exterior](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/5f09bc23-87a2-4f95-9d0c-210d6d7024fa/IGA_0555-00_Hollander_0057-jpg)![New homeowners enjoying their beautiful drees Home living room](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/fa0253cb-ebef-40fd-a764-285c8063212f/IGA_0555-00_Hollander_0092-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### What advice would you give others who are interested in building a home?\n\nDo your research. Visit [several floor plans](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/902e7c2a371d4760aa070779ecf6092c.aspx) and [models](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f0c6301765d94810850ce1d82280a69b.aspx) to determine which options you are drawn to most. Sometimes a home doesn't translate online the same as it does in person. We think it's incredibly helpful to really see options in person, and not just in pictures. Come prepared to your [Design Center appointment](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/613eaed8cff440669c1e7413188f5845.aspx) with [inspirational photos and ideas](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/613eaed8cff440669c1e7413188f5845.aspx#room-gallery). Drees will help you narrow down some choices, but without a vision, the house might feel more disjointed and not end up fitting your family's needs.\n\n![New homeowners enjoying the interior of their Drees Home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4a9a19f3-c342-467d-8fe4-e9cdd3099b66/IGA_0555-00_Hollander_0070-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Why did you choose to build with Drees?\n\nWe wanted to be able to [build on our land](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/902e7c2a371d4760aa070779ecf6092c.aspx), but not build a fully custom home.

Colleen grew up with an abundance of land surrounding her childhood home and craved the serenity that setting provided, so the couple set out to explore pre-existing homes with larger home sites. When they weren't quite finding what they were looking for, their Realtor suggested building. With that, Adam and Colleen began meeting with custom builders, but the first few didn't meet their needs. That's when their Realtor suggested they tour [a Drees model home](https://www.dreeshomes.com/custom-homes/cincinnati-northern-kentucky/floorplans/crestwood/). She mentioned that many of her clients have built with [Drees Homes](https://www.dreeshomes.com/custom-homes/cincinnati-northern-kentucky) and were all very pleased.\n\nAfter touring the Drees [Crestwood model home](https://www.dreeshomes.com/custom-homes/cincinnati-northern-kentucky/floorplans/crestwood/), the Iretons fell in love. They knew instantly that they had found their match. Shortly after that visit, Colleen was running errands and drove past a property for sale. She recalls, \"It was the perfect amount of land for us.\" One hour later, they made an offer and the rest is history!\n\nRead more on their home building journey below.\n\n﻿\n\n#### What floor plan did you choose and what attracted you to this design?\n\n_We knew the moment that we toured the model that the Crestwood would be our home. At first glance, we loved the soaring ceilings, open floor plan and large kitchen. We were also looking for a large basement and spacious laundry room, and this model had it all. Lastly, we stepped out into the outdoor living space with a fireplace and that sealed the deal! The Crestwood literally checked every one of our boxes._\n\n![New homeowners enjoying their luxurious living room with a bright and spacious interior](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/a9eb927f-bb5c-4355-95b8-633f5ea56f54/DYLC-0006-00_Crestwood_Ireton_07-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### As you have watched your new home’s design come to life, what have been your favorite features?\n\n_We love to entertain so the large island in the kitchen is definitely a favorite! We can’t wait to host Thanksgiving with the whole family around that island. In the bathroom, we opted for the “super shower,” which takes up one whole wall. We have never experienced a shower that large! Our favorite part of the house though is the outdoor living space with fireplace. Each morning, we can sit on our deck and sip our coffee just looking out into nature._\n\n#### What did you enjoy most about the building process?\n\n_This was Adam's first time building and my second time. My first experience was a bit stressful with lower quality materials and the communication with the builder was not the best. We were both so pleased to talk to our builder about the progress on our home weekly. We also enjoyed learning more about Drees' building materials and the quality that goes into each home. From beginning to end, each team member listened to us and performed way past expectation. At our walk-through, we were literally at a loss for words. Everything was done impeccably!_\n\n![New homeowners enjoying the front porch of their new Drees Home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/6b49ce69-faac-4f58-9bb5-c00214871de3/DYLC-0006-00_Crestwood_Ireton_04-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### What advice would you give others who are interested in building a home?\n\n_We would tell others to choose Drees. We would tell others that it doesn’t have to be stressful or scary. Drees will support you along the way! You can't beat their professionalism, quality, honesty, attention to detail, etc._\n\n#### Why did you choose to build with Drees?\n\n_We searched other custom builders and did a lot of research before we made our decision. No other builder came close to giving us what we wanted. The quality and amenities that Drees offers are top notch and you cannot beat the price. We can't imagine building with anyone else. As I told the Drees team, \"Well done! Well done!\"_\n\n![New homeowners enjoying their beautiful kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/159eb45d-8933-4f5c-b16b-d522ee67c3d6/DYLC-0006-00_Crestwood_Ireton_06-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Learn More\n\nDreaming of your own Drees home?

thrilled with the Alexander's one-level living layout. It is designed to be right-sized to your family's lifestyle with many options for personalization, including expanding beyond the basic footprint itself! You can select a vaulted ceiling for a dramatic effect, and a sunny morning room would be a nice complement, along with an optional cozy fireplace in the family room. For more elegant entertaining, the third bedroom could instead be a formal dining room. You can also choose a finished lower level with space for a recreation room and a secluded den or home office. Outside, the Alexander can give surprisingly different first impressions, from a welcoming home with a sitting porch to a classic home with a more formal arched entry.\n\n![family room with wall of windows](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/fbb86a9f-d4b8-46b5-bb15-d94d28aefe8b/WDLV-0003-00_Alexander-D_family3-tif)\n\n#### Floor Plan Features\n\n- Convenient one-level living to fit anyone’s lifestyle\n- Open central living area connecting the family room, kitchen and breakfast room\n- Choose from a variety of options such as a sunroom, family room fireplace and primary suite garden bath for a spa-like experience\n\n### Explore this Floor Plan\n\n[Download Brochure](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/7005f999d13611ea/original/B251438-OHCN_Alexander-pdf.pdf) [Customize Your Floor Plan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/interactive/new-homes-cincinnati-northern-kentucky/alexander-floorplan) [Browse Design Choices](https://edc2.envisionoptions.com/org-4000825/presales/plan-8348630/home/index)\n\nMain LevelOptional Lower Level\n\n![Main Level](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/1add452d50edee38/original/Alexander_0FLR1-svg.svg)\n\nReset\n\n[![Drees Logo_white-1](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/logos/drees-logo_white-1.svg)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contact-us/)\n\n[First Equity Mortgage](https://www.firstequityonline.com/)\n\n[Press & News](https://www.dreeshomes.com/press-and-news/)\n\n[Careers](https://www.dreeshomes.com/careers/)\n\nRealtors\n\n[My Home Portal](https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F \"https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F\")\n\n![EHO_LOGO_WHITE](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/b4b14f3e30b740458431ae16fd3c5133/eho_logo_white.svg)\n\nDrees Homes, 211 Grandview Drive Fort Mitchell, KY 41017 \\| (859) 578-4200\n\n\n© 2025 The Drees Company.

the sensible layout that speaks volumes to how families live today? Or could it be the variety of options to make it even more your own? The Buchanan offers a light-filled study with optional French doors as well as an elegant dining room with a dramatic tray ceiling option which also connects to the open kitchen through an optional butler's pantry. The expansive great room can be complemented by an optional sunroom giving you an abundance of natural lighting. You can also choose an optional home office, secluded guest bedroom, or tandem garage as your lifestyle requires. The upstairs can accommodate up to five bedrooms, all with generous walk-in closets, including a voluminous owner's suite. If you choose to add a sunroom downstairs, you can also have a sitting room upstairs in the owner's suite. And, if you'd rather have a gameroom or bonus room upstairs, you can! Finishing the lower level will give you a spacious recreation room with an optional wet bar.\n\n![two-story family room with staircase](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/57b199f4-e9a3-40ef-b11b-18fe86cd1dc1/twc-0720-00_Buchanan-R_family3-tif)\n\n#### Floor Plan Features\n\n- Expansive two-story family room opens to well-designed kitchen\n- Formal dining room with adjoining butler's pantry\n- Second floor can accommodate up to five bedrooms, all with walk-in closets\n\n### Explore this Floor Plan\n\n[Download Brochure](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/23855034c29b1a8c/original/B251306-OHCN_Buchanan-pdf.pdf) [Customize Your Floor Plan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/interactive/new-homes-cincinnati-northern-kentucky/buchanan-floorplan) [Browse Design Choices](https://edc2.envisionoptions.com/org-4000825/presales/plan-8348630/home/index)\n\nMain LevelSecond LevelOptional Lower Level\n\n![Main Level](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/147df10aba1a3a72/original/Buchanan_0FLR1-svg.svg)\n\nReset\n\n[![Drees Logo_white-1](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/logos/drees-logo_white-1.svg)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contact-us/)\n\n[First Equity Mortgage](https://www.firstequityonline.com/)\n\n[Press & News](https://www.dreeshomes.com/press-and-news/)\n\n[Careers](https://www.dreeshomes.com/careers/)\n\nRealtors\n\n[My Home Portal](https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F \"https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F\")\n\n![EHO_LOGO_WHITE](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/b4b14f3e30b740458431ae16fd3c5133/eho_logo_white.svg)\n\nDrees Homes, 211 Grandview Drive Fort Mitchell, KY 41017 \\| (859) 578-4200\n\n\n© 2025 The Drees Company.

well-designed that you won't believe how many choices you have when customizing the floor plan. It starts in the foyer with an optional built-in bench flanked by two cloak closets. Brilliant! Then there's the formal room with an optional tray ceiling for you to express how you entertain. Fabulous! The family living area can have a relaxing fireplace, if you wish. Plus, the kitchen already comes with a generous island and walk-in pantry. Upstairs, the Ashton has four bedrooms, including the luxurious owner's suite featuring a sitting area, sumptuous bath, and large walk-in closet. Or does it? Alternatively, you can select a deluxe owner's bath for further indulgence, a second walk-in closet with or without the sitting room, a private bath for the fourth bedroom, or a bonus room. Incredible! And then there's the option to finish the lower level with a generous recreation room and an optional den. There's so much to love about the flexibility of the Ashton!\n\n![Man chopping fruit in new home kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/fa5c75b6-bea6-4603-a22a-bbf48893bb76/GettyImages-1162988583-jpg)\n\n#### Floor Plan Features\n\n- Welcoming foyer with a unique alcove and two coat closets for extra storage\n- Secluded second floor primary suite with full bath and large walk-in closet\n- Second-floor gameroom and walk-in closets in all secondary bedrooms\n\n### Explore this Floor Plan\n\n[Download Brochure](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/3c6467093c5b8c44/original/B252266-OHCL_Ashton-pdf.pdf) [Customize Your Floor Plan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/interactive/new-homes-cleveland/ashton-floorplan) [Browse Design Choices](https://edc2.envisionoptions.com/org-4000829/presales/plan-8362352)\n\nMain LevelSecond LevelOptional Lower Level\n\n![Main Level](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/4709e5325fe0afc7/original/Ashton_0FLR1-svg.svg)\n\nReset\n\n[![Drees Logo_white-1](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/logos/drees-logo_white-1.svg)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contact-us/)\n\n[First Equity Mortgage](https://www.firstequityonline.com/)\n\n[Press & News](https://www.dreeshomes.com/press-and-news/)\n\n[Careers](https://www.dreeshomes.com/careers/)\n\nRealtors\n\n[My Home Portal](https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F \"https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F\")\n\n![EHO_LOGO_WHITE](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/b4b14f3e30b740458431ae16fd3c5133/eho_logo_white.svg)\n\nDrees Homes, 6860 West Snowville Road, Suite 105 Brecksville, OH 44141-3242 \\| (440) 717-9670\n\n\n© 2025 The Drees Company.

floor plan fits today's busy lifestyles with a living room/study right off the foyer for telecommuters and smart living spaces for the family, including a main-floor owner's suite with an optional garden bath. The great room is all about letting in light: from windows, to skylights, to either a corner or rear fireplace. And, there's a couple of placement options for an additional sunroom, if you'd like. The sleek kitchen is a perfect work triangle with the serving/breakfast bar open to the family and dining areas. Upstairs are three roomy bedrooms all with generous closets. And if you choose to finish the lower level, you'll get a spacious recreation room with a bath option.\n\n![Children enjoying electronics in their new home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/68359c20-f7b9-4b8d-810b-97dfc2ad2528/GettyImages-1284133778-jpg)\n\n#### Floor Plan Features\n\n- Seamless and open flow between the family room, kitchen and dining area\n- Kitchen features an open serving/breakfast bar connecting it to the family and dining areas\n- A dedicated living room/home office near the entrance is ideal for those looking for a functional workspace\n\n### Explore this Floor Plan\n\n[Download Brochure](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/a92dee4af5660ac/original/B230223-OHCL_Chester-pdf.pdf) [Customize Your Floor Plan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/interactive/new-homes-cleveland/chester-floorplan) [Browse Design Choices](https://edc2.envisionoptions.com/org-4000829/presales/plan-8362352)\n\nMain LevelSecond LevelOptional Lower Level\n\n![Main Level](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/7ff6093b91bf8efd/original/Chester_0FLR1-svg.svg)\n\nReset\n\n[![Drees Logo_white-1](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/logos/drees-logo_white-1.svg)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contact-us/)\n\n[First Equity Mortgage](https://www.firstequityonline.com/)\n\n[Press & News](https://www.dreeshomes.com/press-and-news/)\n\n[Careers](https://www.dreeshomes.com/careers/)\n\nRealtors\n\n[My Home Portal](https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F \"https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F\")\n\n![EHO_LOGO_WHITE](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/b4b14f3e30b740458431ae16fd3c5133/eho_logo_white.svg)\n\nDrees Homes, 6860 West Snowville Road, Suite 105 Brecksville, OH 44141-3242 \\| (440) 717-9670\n\n\n© 2025 The Drees Company.

Once rural, Union has experienced unprecedented, but closely directed growth since the early 1980s. Today, Union is the second-largest city in Boone County but is still largely free of so-called \"urban sprawl.\" Attractions such as the 121-acre Boone County Arboretum was the nation's first arboretum to include an active recreation park setting with the botanical gardens connected to 12 athletic fields by a winding multi-use trail. And the Boone County Public School District consistently boasts high marks and is ranked in the top 25 of all school districts in Kentucky. By choosing Drees Homes to build your new custom home in Union you can sample some directed growth of your own as well as Drees distinctive style and well-known homebuyer satisfaction.\n\n###

Instead of tearing down within, watch your brand new home come to life from the ground up while our experienced Elevate by Drees team guides you every step of the way, from contract to keys.\n\n[Build on Your Lot](https://www.dreeshomes.com/new-homes-cincinnati-northern-kentucky/build-on-your-lot/)\n\n## Why Renovate When You Could Rebuild?\n\nIt all starts with location and you may already have the ideal spot to build your dream home rather than to find a new spot to plant your roots. Instead of balancing the constant challenges and pain points of renovating your current home, learn why Elevate by Drees could be the perfect fit for your dream home on your dream home site.\n\n![new home with siding and board and batten](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/ab31135d-fb48-45ab-8f75-c7f6635c12b4/WSTL-0010-00_Ballentine_C_Exterior-Twilight-jpg)\n\n#### Frequently Asked Questions About Rebuilding\n\nOur Elevate by Drees Market Managers often get questions on the possibility of building a new home on their current home site. Let’s answer some commonly asked questions about the process, so you are an expert when the time comes for your unique build!\n\n**Q:** We've been thinking about remodeling our home, but the process feels overwhelming, and I’m not sure it’s worth it. We love our home site and don’t really want to move but know we deserve better. What should we do?\n\n_**A:** Have you ever considered tearing it down and building something brand new instead? [Elevate by Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/010567b0a6544ba0ab4b1260ed1eb672.aspx?redirect_to=build-on-your-lot&is_boyl=true) Homes makes it surprisingly simple and cost-effective. Building new on your current home site eliminates the stress of finding vendors for each job, managing an ever-changing budget and blending modern amenities with outdated spaces when you could have an entire new and modern home with upfront pricing._\n\n**Q:** Rebuilding? That sounds complicated and expensive. How does it work?\n\n**A:** _It’s actually easier than you’d think. [Elevate by Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/010567b0a6544ba0ab4b1260ed1eb672.aspx?redirect_to=build-on-your-lot&is_boyl=true) specializes in building custom homes on your current site. We handle everything, from demolition to designing your dream home. Drees analyzes your home site for free and assesses any modifications, talks through the utilities and forms a vision of the ideal floor plan for your lot before giving you a firm and upfront price for the home build._\n\n![Raise-the-Roof_RGA-0328-00_110](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/cc84ef17-b868-4081-bf0b-32910377ae20/Raise-the-Roof_RGA-0328-00_110-jpg)\n\n#### But What About Costs?\n\n**Q:** But what about the costs? Isn’t it cheaper to remodel?\n\n**A:** _Not always. With [Elevate by Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/010567b0a6544ba0ab4b1260ed1eb672.aspx?redirect_to=build-on-your-lot&is_boyl=true), you avoid the hidden surprises and patchwork repairs of renovations. Plus, we offer financing through our partner, [First Equity Mortgage](https://www.firstequityonline.com/), with flexible terms—no separate construction loan needed. And get this: You only need a 10% deposit or lot equity to get started. And unlike renovating, Elevate backs your new home with a 10-year structural warranty and assistance from our friendly and knowledgeable Customer Care team through the whole process and beyond._\n\n**Q:** That does sound manageable. But I love our location. Would I have to move?\n\n**A:** _Not at all! That’s the beauty of it. You stay on the same site you love, but with a brand-new, custom home tailored to your needs. Imagine modern layouts, energy efficiency, and award-winning floor plans—all without giving up your address._\n\n**Q:** Okay, but I wouldn’t even know where to begin…\n\n**A:** _That’s where [Elevate by Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/010567b0a6544ba0ab4b1260ed1eb672.aspx?redirect_to=build-on-your-lot&is_boyl=true) shines.

Today, I am sharing an idea on my blog for a fall chili bar in partnership with dreeshomes that not only looks good, but also makes dinner a breeze since everyone serves themselves.

they purchased the land and we get to close with a conventional mortgage upon the completion of our home!\n\nselecting finishes in our new home was also much easier with drees. they have a design center here in nky, where we got to spend a lot of time over several appointments picking out exactly what we wanted instead of having to run all over the place to make our selections!!\n\nfinally, we fell in love with a floor plan where we were able to see three fireplaces from standing in one spot in the house. peep the second photo!

modern lines characterize the Quentin floor plan, giving you that refreshed, rejuvenated feeling that home is supposed to. The study just off the main foyer is perfect for working from home. Step up the elegance in the dining room with the tray ceiling option, if you like. The spacious family room offers an optional corner fireplace. The breakfast room and kitchen flow easily from the family room, reflecting how families really live today. The upstairs landing opens into the bonus room with four generous bedrooms, including the plush owner's suite, wrapping around it. All bedrooms have considerable walk-in closets and the owner's bath has the optional luxurious garden tub. And what's not to like about the upstairs laundry? For even more space, consider finishing the lower level to include an enormous recreation room and den.\n\n![secondary bedroom with canopy bed](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/c3b2b14e-a76a-40b8-9647-3dd2dcf0c94a/HMD-0002-00_Quentin-F_bedroom2-tif)\n\n#### Floor Plan Features\n\n- Mixing formal and casual open spaces make the Quentin an ideal family plan\n- A cook's kitchen with a center prep island, large walk-in pantry and plenty of counter space\n- The upstairs has four bedrooms plus a gameroom for family fun\n\n### Explore this Floor Plan\n\n[Download Brochure](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/7d935c30077d954a/original/B252192-OHCN_Quentin_REV-pdf.pdf) [Browse Design Choices](https://edc2.envisionoptions.com/org-4000825/presales/plan-8348630/home/index)\n\nMain LevelSecond LevelOptional Lower Level\n\n![Main Level](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/m/25c3384fe0de7647/original/Quentin_0FLR1-svg.svg)\n\nReset\n\n[![Drees Logo_white-1](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/logos/drees-logo_white-1.svg)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contact-us/)\n\n[First Equity Mortgage](https://www.firstequityonline.com/)\n\n[Press & News](https://www.dreeshomes.com/press-and-news/)\n\n[Careers](https://www.dreeshomes.com/careers/)\n\nRealtors\n\n[My Home Portal](https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F \"https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F\")\n\n![EHO_LOGO_WHITE](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/b4b14f3e30b740458431ae16fd3c5133/eho_logo_white.svg)\n\nDrees Homes, 211 Grandview Drive Fort Mitchell, KY 41017 \\| (859) 578-4200\n\n\n© 2025 The Drees Company.

Friends gather. Opportunities open. Life is always in motion, and you’re ready for a new home that will move along with it. Building a home can feel overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. At Drees Homes, we understand that choosing a new home is one of the most important decisions you’ll ever make. We take the worry out of the process so you can concentrate on what matters most to you: realizing the dream of your Drees custom home.\n\n- [Planning Your Home](https://www.dreeshomes.com/the-building-process/#planning-your-new-drees-home)\n- [Location, Location](https://www.dreeshomes.com/the-building-process/#location,-location,-location!)\n- [The Construction Process](https://www.dreeshomes.com/the-building-process/#the-construction-process)\n\n## Planning Your New Drees Home\n\nBuying any home is a big decision. With a little careful thought before you begin the process, you can feel confident that the decisions you make are the right ones for you.\n\n## Should You Build Or Buy A Move-In-Ready Home?\n\nWhile some people enjoy the creative challenge of a blank canvas, others prefer to focus their attention on making small changes to an existing masterpiece. Whether you’re a creator or an embellisher, we have a variety of homes and home sites in conveniently-located communities to work with your lifestyle.\n\n![interior wood framing of house under construction](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/a7e623ba-138d-49da-8f67-cb7f3efc8082/GettyImages-182898976-jpg)\n\n#### Why Build a Custom Home?\n\nTo some prospective homebuyers, the words “dream home” evoke images of building a custom home just the way they want it. The thrill of selecting a floor plan that suits the way they live, choosing home design details, and working with a builder to realize their vision. And now is your time.\n\nWith a Drees custom home, you can:\n\n• Tailor your home to fit your life.\n\n• Select colors, materials, and textures that reflect your style.\n\n• Choose a floor plan for your family or entertaining needs.\n\n• Experience our worry-free building process.\n\nAnd every Drees home is future-proofed with our home technology infrastructure and energy-efficient systems of our DreeSmart Innovations.\n\n![custom home with stone and siding](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/dcc123b2-548a-444b-897d-d2f002590d3a/HMR-0005-00_Hialeah_A-exterior-jpg)\n\n#### Why Buy a Move-In Ready Home?\n\nMany factors go into deciding to buy a move-in ready home. If you’re transferring to another city, you might not have time to plan and wait for the construction of a build-to-order home. Or you might prefer the simplicity of moving into a “ready now” home that fits your lifestyle and needs.\n\nWhatever your reasons, you don’t have to sacrifice distinctive home design for convenience. Drees offers quality new homes that have been built with many of the features and upgrades you are looking for in a custom home:\n\n• Spacious floor plans\n\n• Beautiful design details\n\n• Quality construction materials\n\n• Conveniently-located communities\n\n## Location, Location, Location!\n\nCommunities are not one-style-fits-all. Your community should reflect who you are and how you want to live. It’s as much a lifestyle choice as your home’s floor plan or design.\n\n![Aerial view of home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/0c87cf0e-bebf-4a0e-a37b-c4c86cd069d7/SLF-0045-00_Great-Falls-E_aerial-tif)\n\n#### Build on Your Lot\n\nInterested in building your dream home, but own land or prefer a home site outside an established Drees community?

You’ve selected your floor plan and made your design choices. You’ve put down your first deposit. And now, it’s time for construction to begin. Your new home construction comprises six distinct steps, from excavating the foundation all the way to the final cleaning and inspection. Here is a general overview of each phase of construction.\n\n1. ![foundation_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/foundation_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![foundation texture_dark](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/f46ab69a027d4e99bb83eb56f6bd45f3/foundation-texture_dark.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### PHASE 1\n\n\n\n## Foundation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nConstruction begins with home site excavation. Your home’s position is staked on the lot and prepped for the foundation. Depending on the region your home is built in, your new home’s foundation consists of a slab, block or poured wall foundation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlabBlockPoured Wall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nForms are set, and an outline of the new home begins to take shape. Underground plumbing is installed and tied into the public sewer system. After a bit of prep work, the slab is poured creating the foundation of your home.\n\n2. ![contractor and couple_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/contractor-and-couple_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![woodgrain_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/woodgrain_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### PHASE 2\n\n\n\n## Framing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFraming is the phase where things really start to take shape. In the framing phase, the subfloor, walls, and roof structure are built, and your roof is shingled. Window and door units are installed. Many homeowners think their home is near completion at the end of this stage. Actually, we are still only about one third of the way through construction. In the following phases we are getting into the fine details which may not be as apparent but are vital to your finished home.\n\n3. ![GettyImages-176828976_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/gettyimages-176828976_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![rough mechanics lightbulbs_dark](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/a6d7cf6d08924f0d8e5924acf2daa448/rough-mechanics-lightbulbs_dark.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### PHASE 3\n\n\n\n## Rough Mechanics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Rough mechanics” is the term used for the mechanical portions of building including heating, air conditioning, plumbing and electric. This construction phase is a swarm of activity as plumbing and indoor sewer pipes, your furnace and ducts, and electric wiring, outlets, and switches are installed.\n\n\n\n\n\nToward the end of this phase, the Builder will perform a pre-drywall review with you. This review is an opportunity to go over the work already done on your home and discuss work to be completed in the next three phases.\n\n4. ![drywall_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/drywall_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![drywall texture_dark](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/4eb86271ef71488cbd42fd048a849f02/drywall-texture_dark.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### PHASE 4\n\n\n\n## Drywall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drywall phase of home construction shows progress rather quickly. Rooms are separated and divided, giving you the visual effect of each space. Drywall is hung and finished, and the ceilings are insulated. Outside brick, stone and siding are installed; and your home site is graded for drainage and to prepare for the driveway, patios, walks and so on.\n\n5. ![BFE-0001-00_Northwood C Primary Bath2_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/bfe-0001-00_northwood-c-primary-bath2_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![interior finishes marble_dark](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/cd6d0f0b2ef1491d8ac17201d1472e08/interior-finishes-marble_dark.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### PHASE 5\n\n\n\n## Interior Finishes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interior finishes phase is probably one of the most exciting phases. You’ll see many of the selections you made at your Drees Design Center come to life. This is when the Builder installs kitchen and bath cabinetry, countertops, mirrors, medicine cabinets, interior doors and trim, stair rails, and many other detail features.\n\n6. ![BILS-0003-00_Alwick_family1_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/bils-0003-00_alwick_family1_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n![carpet_dark](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/a4972c39e9cb4564a005b76542fe6249/carpet_dark.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n#### PHASE 6\n\n\n\n## Final\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring this construction phase, kitchen appliances and flooring – vinyl, ceramic, and hardwood – are installed, and both the interior and exterior of your home are painted. Later in this phase, you’ll see carpeting and your yard is finish-graded, seeded or sodded. Finishing touches are added, such as cleaning the windows, floors, baths, kitchen and so on.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn internal quality assurance inspection ensures your new home is in accordance with your custom architectural plan. After your New Home Presentation and Closing are conducted, you’ll be ready to move in!\n\n\nItem 1 of 6\n\n1. 1\n\n2. 2\n\n3. 3\n\n4. 4\n\n5. 5\n\n6. 6\n\n\nItem 3 of 6\n\n[![MH_Blog_08_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/mh_blog_08_drees.jpg?width=4800)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/distinctive-design/)\n\n### Making Design Selections\n\nYour home is more than a dwelling, it’s an expression of who you are and what you value.\n\n[Explore the Design Process](https://www.dreeshomes.com/distinctive-design/)\n\n[![GettyImages-875249534_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/gettyimages-875249534_drees.jpg?width=4800)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/financing/)\n\n### Your New Home Financing\n\nAllow us to assist you in simplifying and unraveling the complexities of home financing, including credit scores, mortgage options and interest rates.\n\n[Learn About Home Financing](https://www.dreeshomes.com/financing/)\n\n[![MOTL-0026-00_Buchanan_Bober_05_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/production-ready/build-the-building-process/motl-0026-00_buchanan_bober_05_drees.jpg?width=4800)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/customer-care/)\n\n### Drees Customer Care\n\nOur goal is to provide you with outstanding customer service and peace of mind.\n\n[Learn About Customer Care](https://www.dreeshomes.com/customer-care/)\n\n[![Drees Logo_white-1](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/logos/drees-logo_white-1.svg)](https://www.dreeshomes.com/)\n\n[Contact Us](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contact-us/)\n\n[First Equity Mortgage](https://www.firstequityonline.com/)\n\n[Press & News](https://www.dreeshomes.com/press-and-news/)\n\n[Careers](https://www.dreeshomes.com/careers/)\n\nRealtors\n\n[My Home Portal](https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F \"https://myhome.dreeshomes.com/signin?redirect=%2F\")\n\n![EHO_LOGO_WHITE](https://www.dreeshomes.com/contentassets/b4b14f3e30b740458431ae16fd3c5133/eho_logo_white.svg)\n\nDrees Homes, 211 Grandview Drive Fort Mitchell, KY 41017\n\n© 2025 The Drees Company.

The past few years has transformed the way people view their home - home offices are no longer a wish list item, but a must-have. There’s an emphasis on the outdoor living area like never before, and today’s kitchen must be as beautiful and functional as ever. The modern-day home must be able to do it all.\n\nThe home office isn’t going anywhere anytime soon. These setups offer space, privacy and video conference-worthy backdrops and lighting. Most of our floor plans offer a dedicated space for the study, but some homeowners opt to transform a gameroom or a loft into a functional workspace.\n\n![Kitchen with dark blue cabinets](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/ed6e25a4-c34c-4778-8ecd-c839c6e54fd5/MER8-0001-2M_Leighton_Kitchen-01-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nThe kitchen has always been the heart of the home, but in modern times, this space has become the heart and hub of the home. All Drees kitchens are open and airy, but it’s important to consider a floor plan that prioritizes this space if home cooking and entertaining are priorities for you. Some floor plans allow for an expansive, oversized island; others have a working pantry to store food items, appliances and gadgets.\n\n![coffee bar and pantry](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/a5ca71b4-cd24-4905-abcf-2e5a53d28c05/MER8-0001-2M_Leighton_Kitchen-05-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nWhen it comes to the layout of your kitchen, dining area and family room - don’t fret. Most of our floor plans incorporate Drees’ signature living triangle, an open floor plan concept in which the kitchen, family room and dining area are adjacent. This setup makes for functional everyday living and optimal entertaining opportunities.\n\nMoving outside, many of our floor plans feature spacious outdoor living areas, which you can complete with a covered porch, fireplace and dining space. Some of our floor plans even offer the option for you to extend this area, so you can have plenty of space to entertain outdoors.\n\n![covered patio with fireplace](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/5908f08c-dce3-4085-b6e2-8038dd561b17/LTBY-0049-00_Marabelle_B_Rear-Covered-Porch-Twilight-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nWhen selecting a floor plan, it’s imperative to consider which areas of the home are a priority for you and your family.

interior](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/bb5e5f8d-796f-4ddf-841b-778d0a78d4ba/DYLC-0006-00_Crestwood_Ireton_08-jpg)\n\n# Flexible Living in the Sarasota\n\nThe all-new Sarasota plan presents convenient living mostly on one level. The entry foyer leads to an open and inviting arrangement of the family room with optional corner fireplace, well-equipped kitchen and bright, airy dining space - the perfect spot to entertain or relax with friends and family. A covered porch off the family room lets you enjoy the outdoors. Situated in the rear of the home, you'll find a private owner's suite with its own luxury bath and huge walk-in closet.

The couple, who are traveling nurses, made design selections for their Nashville-area home whilst on assignment thousands of miles away.\n\nAshley will be the first to tell you: She and her husband are anything but traditional. When they set out to build their dream home, they knew they wanted it in mostly brick, and they wanted it mostly black.\n\n“We had looked at all different types of home and having a house we were able to build and put our own touches on really motivated us to go with a new build,” Ashley said.\n\nWithout further ado, step inside the Northway “Addams Family” home.\n\n![Drees new home welcomes family](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/58633a84-4e5f-41cf-8cb7-016c341ca8ab/RPC-0034-00_Northway_16-jpg)![new homeowner relaxing with Drees](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/03de138a-e1bf-4a91-9106-c69fe8d40f63/RPC-0034-00_Northway_27-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### What floor plan did you choose and what attracted you to this design?\n\n_My husband and I chose the [Everly floor plan.](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/34bf37273e7549619b191aa56ce55949.aspx) We had come to [Nashville](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f06e405acffb463b97cc72afbf047902.aspx?view=floorplans) in hopes of finding our dream home. Being from out of state, we went with a goal in mind to find a house we could see ourselves growing in. We had a Realtor show us around and I will never forget he took us to an [Everly](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/34bf37273e7549619b191aa56ce55949.aspx) that was in the process of being built. Shawn and I walked in, and it immediately took our breath away. We knew this had to be the house we built._\n\n![Congratulations to the Northways New Drees Home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/326c82cc-5aed-4231-899c-595d13ff1a06/RPC-0034-00_Northway_31-jpg)\n\n![Furry friend relaxes in new Drees home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/a1342036-f342-4c5b-a9bd-2cdf7a3149d4/RPC-0034-00_Northway_29-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### As you have watched your new home’s design come to life, what have been your favorite features?\n\n_Shawn and I are not traditional by any means, we both love the color black! Working with Drees, we were able to build our “Addams Family” home. It is our favorite feature of our home. It stands out in the neighborhood!_\n\n![new homeowner relaxing with Drees](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/9f182f08-c30b-4416-802b-304b009b4236/RPC-0034-00_Northway_26-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### What did you enjoy most about the building process?\n\n_We have a different building experience than most. My husband and I are both travel nurses which had provided us with an abundance of adventure, but also brought the challenges of building a home from out of state. The [building process](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f4d7d3220dee43059d13b381b6f24e35.aspx) with Drees was so seamless. A huge shoutout to Bruce and Rob who constantly kept us in the loop, took pictures, sent weekly emails, and no matter the request, they always made it happen! I will never forget doing our [Design Center](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/5210545a3e2b4adf9ea88d815b944082.aspx) meeting virtually from our cabin in Alaska.

When you see your home come to life and walk through the front door, there is no better feeling!_\n\n#### Why did you choose to build with Drees?\n\n_We had spent a week in Nashville when we were ready to put roots down there. We had seen many new builds and I will never forget a representative from another builder tell us we would never find a four-sided brick home. She told us, “No one is building that anymore, you won’t find it.” We both knew we wanted an all-brick home. We continued our search and had heard about Drees and its great reputation. Low and behold, we have an all-brick home!_\n\n![relaxing on in the custom outdoor living space](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/056c9d98-7d56-4ae0-96e0-9d01433ed087/RPC-0034-00_Northway_21-jpg)![custom new home outdoor living space](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/13a4e62d-b76f-498e-a81f-836e32e2b6e6/RPC-0034-00_Northway_22-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Learn More\n\nDreaming of your own Drees home?

Just 16 miles from downtown Cincinnati, Hebron is also close to all of the big-city cultural amenities the Queen City can provide like the Cincinnati Symphony, Ballet, and Reds and Bengals ballgames. And in the summer, the Riverbend Music Center is a mecca for evening outdoor entertainment. Back in Hebron, the Boone County Public School District consistently boasts high marks and is ranked in the top 25 of all school districts in Kentucky.

From the timeless sophistication showcased in [Architectural Digest](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/patio-cover-ideas), to the inviting elegance celebrated by [House Beautiful](https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g38210397/kitchen-trends-2022/), and the thoughtful, refined design praised by [Martha Stewart](https://www.marthastewart.com/green-bathroom-ideas-11678815), our homes are making waves in all the right places. This growing recognition is both an honor and a testament to the luxury, quality and craftsmanship that define every Drees home. Let’s take a moment to walk through some of our most exciting media features, each one a proud milestone in our journey to create homes that are as livable as they are luxurious.\n\n﻿\n\n#### Architectural Digest\n\n﻿\n\nIn Architectural Digest’s beautifully curated article, “ [36 Patio Cover Ideas That Make Outdoor Living a Breeze](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/patio-cover-ideas),” Drees Homes was highlighted for its thoughtful approach to blending indoor comfort with outdoor living. Architecture Designer Paige Foss shared, “You can enhance traditional exterior surfaces and adorn the patio as you would any other room in the home. For a simple DIY project, add lattice with greenery to further blur the line between interior and exterior.”\n\n﻿\n\nThe featured design goes beyond functionality. Decorated latticework adds a touch of castle-like sophistication, bringing a sense of grandeur and timeless elegance to the outdoor space. It’s a subtle yet luxurious detail that transforms the patio into a refined retreat, echoing the same level of craftsmanship found throughout the home.\n\n![outdoor courtyard with a dining table](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4e3cebc2-767a-486f-9099-cea4ad3629f9/LTBY-0049-00_Marabelle_B_Outdoor-Living-1-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nArchitectural Digest also spotlighted the stunning outdoor living space of our [Crestwood model home](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/69805bbb8cf4460f8093991b052b15a1.aspx) in Cincinnati as a true showcase of elevated outdoor design and versatility in their recent \" [Backyard Patio Ideas: 100+ Tricks to Take Your Yard From Drab to Fab](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/backyard-patio-ideas-and-tricks)\" feature. This thoughtfully curated backyard unfolds into a series of distinct entertainment zones, including a cozy fire pit enclave with modern seating, lush green lawns and graceful stone pathways that invite exploration. Framed by elegant landscaping, the space seamlessly blends comfort and sophistication, creating the ultimate outdoor oasis for both lively gatherings and tranquil retreats.\n\n﻿\n\nBeing recognized by Architectural Digest, a leader in design excellence, is a true honor. This feature is a testament to the creative vision and meticulous attention to detail that define every Drees home.\n\n![aerial view of home rear exterior and outdoor living area](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/10d6e0fe-f387-445a-90ff-ad49b4709e8a/CKT-0148-00_Crestwood-D_Outdoor-Living-08-tif)\n\n﻿\n\n#### House Beautiful\n\n﻿\n\nIn House Beautiful’s feature, “ [These Are the Kitchen Trends You'll Be Seeing This Year, According to Designers](https://www.housebeautiful.com/design-inspiration/g38210397/kitchen-trends-2022/),” Drees Homes offered a stylish take on kitchen design. [Alexa Drees Walker, Director of the Drees Homes Design Center](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/1204d05779634dfc93b763d810f3841c.aspx), predicted that “architectural statement hoods will be big—and I mean literally!” She also noted that “whites and creams paired with darker, earthy hues will be used to create drama,” while “marble-inspired quartz countertops will become a newly beloved backsplash option,” marking a shift away from traditional subway tile. “Gold accents and oversized pendants will remain popular,” she added, reinforcing the continued appeal of warm metallics and bold lighting.\n\n![kitchen with white cabinets and large island](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/cd7b9506-0687-44d2-ac59-b5febdf2a869/SAT8-0015-00_Naples-G_kitchen1-tif)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Martha Stewart\n\n﻿\n\nIn a recent [Martha Stewart feature,](https://www.marthastewart.com/green-bathroom-ideas-11678815 \"https://www.marthastewart.com/green-bathroom-ideas-11678815\") “12 Green Bathroom Ideas, From Subtle Sage to Electric Emerald,” the [Belleville floor plan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/bcf7b10a2ef04c369076c8dcb29fd46b.aspx) by Drees Homes was recognized for its bold and refreshing approach to color.

Described as a creamy greenish gray, this earthy sage green strikes a perfect balance between modern cottage charm and timeless elegance.

No matter how you choose to design your outdoor living space, our goal is the same: To make your [outdoor living](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/outdoor-living-design/) area one that is beautiful, functional and blends seamlessly with the interior of your home.\n\n#### Must-have \\#1: Outdoor fire\n\nWhether you select a stylish outdoor fireplace or a rustic fire pit, there's no denying that incorporating fire is a quintessential piece of outdoor living design.\n\nFor [entertaining that feels elevated](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/patriotic-party-inspiration/), design your outdoor space so that your TV is built in just above the fireplace. Not only is this design conducive for entertaining, it makes for the perfect spot for relaxing or family movie night.\n\n![outdoor living area with fireplace](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/7260250f-6a19-4b43-933e-356bc413ed58/STCK-0118_Belvidere-C_Outdoor-Living-2-jpg)\n\n![outdoor living area with glass french doors](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/399fe3d0-129f-48a0-aed8-d9a77ef3dd52/STCK-0118_Belvidere-C_Outdoor-Living-3-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Must-have \\#2: Dining area\n\nOutdoor kitchen and dining setups are ideal for entertaining. The grill is an obvious must-have, but a built-in gourmet grilling area, complete with surface space for food prep or a buffet, a sink and other common kitchen luxuries like a mini fridge, wine cooler, warming drawer or ice maker, is a winning setup for any outdoor chef!\n\nThe best part about having a functional outdoor living space is that you can entertain fully without missing out on the fun! Our open, functional patio design truly allows the host to both entertain and be a part of the party.\n\n![new Drees home outdoor living area with grill and countertops](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/7b893695-6368-46fd-98bb-dbf0842a0f2f/CLTR-0017-K_Lynmar-II-B_Outdoor-Living-11-jpg)\n\n![outdoor courtyard with a dining table](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4e3cebc2-767a-486f-9099-cea4ad3629f9/LTBY-0049-00_Marabelle_B_Outdoor-Living-1-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Must-have \\#3: Distinct zones\n\nOur outdoor living areas are designed to be spacious enough to host a crowd. You can even design your space so it extends to your backyard so your outdoor living area has multiple zones. This is the perfect approach if you have several outdoor living areas on your wishlist. Creating distinct zones for entertainment, dining, conversation, backyard fun or relaxing around the fire will not only maximize the functionality but also create a space that is visually interesting and beautiful.\n\n![Outdoor living patio with a firepite](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/5974622c-6e28-4e0b-9088-474e6f6e539b/Channing-RGO_PATIO1-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nSome homeowners opt for a fire pit in addition or instead of an outdoor fireplace. There’s no denying that a fire pit has a nostalgic feel to it - plus, these spaces are perfect for hosting a group when the sun goes down. Large, flowy outdoor living spaces are ideal for hosting the game, a dinner party or for simply enjoying warm summer nights with family.\n\n![new Drees home rear exterior with firepit and pool](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/25f39188-c5d3-4bd0-839b-211af5e0a0ae/CLTR-0017-K_Lynmar-II-B_Outdoor-Living-07-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Must-have \\#4: Covered patio\n\nWhen you choose to build a covered patio, you can entertain in comfort - rain or shine! Or, take it a step further and opt for a screened-in porch. Having your space enclosed will allow you and your guests to enjoy the outdoors while being totally shielded from the elements.\n\nOur covered patios are as beautiful as they are functional. Some homeowners opt to bring the outdoor elements into this space - select wooden features for the ceiling or pick cedar beams for a pop of rustic flair.\n\n![covered porch with multi-panel sliding door to family room](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/85587e42-bd6c-4947-b059-081f98fe87f7/WRSF-0022-A_Brady-A_Outdoor-Living-02-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n### Ready to start designing your dream home?\n\n![new Drees home outdoor living area with firepit and pool](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/02df85da-4d1d-4156-9c37-902d721154ed/CLTR-0017-K_Lynmar-II-B_Outdoor-Living-05-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nFrom [Instagram inspiration](https://www.instagram.com/dreeshomes/?hl=en) and [Pinterest pins](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/_saved/) to your final floor plan, Drees makes it easy to bring it all together.

Needs!\n\nThe Alden presents open, spacious living in a comfortable 2-story plan that's designed with your needs in mind. From the open foyer, you'll view a flex room that can be used as a private home office or formal dining room. An open arrangement of the family room with optional corner fireplace, kitchen with generous serving island, and dining area is a great space for relaxing or entertaining. You'll step down from the family room area to an enormous gameroom, which will be a favorite among family and friends. Upstairs is a secluded primary suite with a luxury bath and large walk-in closet. You'll love the convenience of having a second floor laundry room. And you can personalize the Alden to suit your family's needs with a variety of options, including a sunroom off the main floor dining area, a first floor guest suite, and an optional pass through from the kitchen to the flex room, Second floor options offer an primary bath with a super shower or garden bath, optional bath at bedroom 2, a loft, or a 5th bedroom.

They had purchased their own land with the goal to eventually build on it. Their previous home was set on several acres, and they had grown to love having the extra space.\n\nThat's where the [Elevate by Drees Homes](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/902e7c2a371d4760aa070779ecf6092c.aspx?view=floorplans) team came in. Through this Build on Your Lot program, Drees empowers homebuyers to move beyond traditional subdivisions, constructing their dream homes on cherished land, within upscale custom communities or in historic neighborhoods. [Elevate by Drees Homes](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/902e7c2a371d4760aa070779ecf6092c.aspx?view=floorplans) allows homeowners to elevate their home building experience, whether they desire five acres, a custom community or rebuilding on an existing site.\n\nNatalie Hollander explained, \"The flexibility that Drees Homes provided throughout our build on your lot journey cannot be overstated. We loved making tweaks that we knew would fit us better based on previous builds. We truly feel like we got it exactly as we wanted this time.\"\n\nJake and Natalie sat down to share insights into their home building journey.\n\n﻿\n\n#### What floor plan did you choose and what attracted you to this design?\n\nWe chose the [Buchanan floor plan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/custom-homes/indianapolis/build-on-your-lot/buchanan/) because it offered several options we were wanting in our new home. We were first drawn to the exterior that is shown on the local model home, but quickly realized the interior options had exactly what we wanted as well. The ability to have four large bedrooms upstairs as a family of five was very important to us. We also made changes to the kitchen, great room and sunroom areas to allow for a more open layout to better fit our lifestyle.\n\n![New homeowners enjoying their new Drees Home kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/5c289af0-d0c7-46d8-a18b-6e9742aba1f4/IGA_0555-00_Hollander_0076-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### As you have watched your new home’s design come to life, what have been your favorite features?\n\nWe really enjoyed seeing the first floor kitchen/great room/sunroom area come to life. Fortunately, Drees was able to accommodate [a few floor plan modifications](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/c0dd7b4ef0394976a2f84a0f0a702f3e.aspx) that really turned the [Buchanan](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/7cad8cb4cfff4bf589769a49badee9d7.aspx) into our own. We decided to enlarge and rotate the kitchen island so that it faces the sunroom, which is a feature I think I enjoy most in our home.\n\n#### What did you enjoy most about the building process?\n\nThe [Design appointments](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/613eaed8cff440669c1e7413188f5845.aspx) and the structure of [the build phases](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f4d7d3220dee43059d13b381b6f24e35.aspx). It was exciting to see what felt like [endless options, colors and styles to choose from](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/613eaed8cff440669c1e7413188f5845.aspx#room-gallery). I loved having the ability to really make our home our own based on color choices. We had previously built a custom home and struggled with the lack of process and what felt like a lot of last minute decisions. We truly appreciate the standard process and knowing what to expect throughout.\n\n![New homeowners in front of their Drees home exterior](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/5f09bc23-87a2-4f95-9d0c-210d6d7024fa/IGA_0555-00_Hollander_0057-jpg)![New homeowners enjoying their beautiful drees Home living room](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/fa0253cb-ebef-40fd-a764-285c8063212f/IGA_0555-00_Hollander_0092-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### What advice would you give others who are interested in building a home?\n\nDo your research. Visit [several floor plans](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/902e7c2a371d4760aa070779ecf6092c.aspx) and [models](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f0c6301765d94810850ce1d82280a69b.aspx) to determine which options you are drawn to most. Sometimes a home doesn't translate online the same as it does in person. We think it's incredibly helpful to really see options in person, and not just in pictures. Come prepared to your [Design Center appointment](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/613eaed8cff440669c1e7413188f5845.aspx) with [inspirational photos and ideas](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/613eaed8cff440669c1e7413188f5845.aspx#room-gallery). Drees will help you narrow down some choices, but without a vision, the house might feel more disjointed and not end up fitting your family's needs.\n\n![New homeowners enjoying the interior of their Drees Home](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4a9a19f3-c342-467d-8fe4-e9cdd3099b66/IGA_0555-00_Hollander_0070-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Why did you choose to build with Drees?\n\nWe wanted to be able to [build on our land](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/902e7c2a371d4760aa070779ecf6092c.aspx), but not build a fully custom home.

Warm wood tones and pops of color create an inviting palette that are ideal for everyday simple living.\n\n4. ![WEX-0027-00_Bedford B_kitchen2_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/wex-0027-00_bedford-b_kitchen2_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n![mac-0032-vanderburgh-Primary Bath2_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/mac-0032-vanderburgh-primary-bath2_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n![RED-0590-00_Cohen C_bedroom3_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/red-0590-00_cohen-c_bedroom3_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n![Modern Coastal_Outlined_Gray_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/collage-item-logo/modern-coastal_outlined_gray_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis Nantucket-inspired style is simple, light and airy with a color scheme that reflects the ocean and sky.

To achieve this style, start with a neutral palette and add finishes with a contemporary, rustic edge. Consider simple Shaker cabinets, copper or black light fixtures, board & batten, wood beams or a-frame architecture.\n\n6. ![CRWD-0030-00_Finley G_lowerlevel-wineroom1_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/crwd-0030-00_finley-g_lowerlevel-wineroom1_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n![WF7-0002-00_Haley A_dining2_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/wf7-0002-00_haley-a_dining2_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n![RF66-0003-00_Buchanan M_family1_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/rf66-0003-00_buchanan-m_family1_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n![Rustic_Outlined_Gray_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/collage-item-logo/rustic_outlined_gray_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRustic style has an earthy feel about it. This simple, casual, natural style features reclaimed wood, stone, and fabrics like burlap and canvas. Traditionally, you might equate rustic style with a lodge feel, but many people also incorporate touches of Tuscan, Southwest, coastal and cottage accents in their rustic-style home.\n\n7. ![plc-0057-00_Belleville F_Home Office_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/plc-0057-00_belleville-f_home-office_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n![CRWD-0030-00_Finley G_entry_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/crwd-0030-00_finley-g_entry_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n![motl-9999-00_Vanderburgh B_dining1_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/cleveland/collage-block/motl-9999-00_vanderburgh-b_dining1_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n![Sophisticated Traditional_Outlined_Gray_Drees](https://www.dreeshomes.com/globalassets/design-center/collage-item-logo/sophisticated-traditional_outlined_gray_drees.jpg?width=4800)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSophisticated traditional style is timeless, calm, luxurious and ornate.

Design experts from [Architectural Digest](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/interior-design-trends-2025) are forecasting earth tones to take over in the new year, expecting people to choose [warmer and deeper colors](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/interior-design-trends-2025) in 2025.\n\n#### Show-stopping appliances\n\n![new Drees home modern kitchen with gold hardware](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/6c67cc13-241c-4bde-9fee-831eb138fdc7/CLTR-0017-K_Lynmar-II-B_Kitchen-05-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nHot in the kitchen in the new year: Top-of-the-line, statement making appliances.\n\nOur homeowners desire cookware that are not only versatile, but beautiful. The modern day appliance must enhance the overall design of the kitchen. Functionality is not enough.\n\n![custom kitchen with stainless steel gas range](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4da9c998-2fc0-48ca-b6cc-5f033ea27d37/KCH-1226-00_Elmsdale-B_Kitchen_6-jpg)![Kitchen Aid six burner gas cooktop](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/9baabcb0-55a9-41e5-93fc-6b26573a1247/OSC-0001-00_Bedford-E_Kitchen_004-tif)\n\n﻿\n\n“We are witnessing a surge in demand for appliances that not only bring culinary expertise to your fingertips and handle multiple cooking tasks (hello, built-in air-fry!), but also enhance the kitchen’s design, making a statement rather than blending into the background,” Alexa said.\n\n#### Vintage-inspired design\n\n![family room with contemporary fireplace](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/229e6a34-083c-47d3-89a1-d3c673fb452a/TRAP-0377-00_Kenai-B_family2-tif)\n\n﻿\n\nHomeowners are finding comfort in familiar finishes and furnishings that nod to the past. Adding vintage-inspired or nostalgic colors - think olive greens, rust oranges, mustard yellows and rich browns - playful patterns and designs can create a cozy reprieve from the hustle and bustle of modern-day life.\n\n“Think warm colors, stained wood, artisan tiles with imperfect texture and detailed embellishments in lighting and plumbing fixtures,” Alexa said.\n\n[Nashville's](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f06e405acffb463b97cc72afbf047902.aspx?view=neighborhoods) newest [Elmsdale model](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/30349bb6c8a04489a0951bdec42a3555.aspx) at [Kings' Chapel](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/521b35027a2f490d962fb53a6991899f.aspx?mapState=false&view=floorplans) showcases this beautifully. The [Elmsdale's](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/30349bb6c8a04489a0951bdec42a3555.aspx) family room features rustic, wooden beams and a colonial-style chandelier.\n\n![open concept family room and kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/7b130303-eb76-4a74-b17e-61903f896647/KCH-1226-00_Elmsdale-B_FamilyRoom_4-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n[Pantone’s Color of the Year](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f552d987c98a48ffb234afb03a03188f.aspx) is in line with vintage-inspired design. [Mocha Mousse,](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f552d987c98a48ffb234afb03a03188f.aspx) a warming, brown hue imbued with richness, will be a popular shade in 2025. This brown/pink shade proves that brown is back for home design choices, from paint to furntiture to wall decor. Expect to see Pantone's Mocha Mousse (or at least a variation of it) and lots of earth tones in the home this year.\n\n#### More is more!\n\n![Primary Suite with tray ceiling and wainscoting](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/41918d16-3c61-454b-8c38-a25fd7fcf094/WRSF-0022-A_Brady-A_Primary-Suite-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nMaximalism is in vogue. This trend is the intersection of color, pattern and drama. Expect color and bold patterns in tile, cabinetry and other finishes.\n\nThis year will be all about infusing individuality into the home, and this means that safe shades will be cast aside. Homeowners are more apt to select colors and finishes that were considered too permanent to take a risk on in previous years. Alexa’s advice: If you love it now, chances are you’ll love it for years to come.\n\n![family room with contemporary fireplace](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/dd8ebbf0-1b2c-4e13-abcd-9206b85e2339/AUD7-0006-2_Brookdale-II-B_Family-Room-03jpg-jpg)\n\n![freestanding tub with brass faucet](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/d2b0c231-9484-4eb6-b334-01bebff15b17/AUD7-0006-2_Brookdale-II-B_Primary-Bath-05-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n“Less home buyers today are concerned with how their home design will affect resale value and more interested in how their interiors and surroundings will spark their own happiness,” Alexa said.\n\nSimilarly, [Architectural Digest](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/interior-design-trends-2025) is predicting homeowners will be all about real personality and [embracing immersive interiors](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/interior-design-trends-2025) \\- mixing patterns, using floor-to-ceiling color and incorporating bold art and decor.\n\n#### European farmhouse exteriors\n\n![Drees custom home with cozy front porch](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4ab17c0f-ad75-46a5-a047-ace9f5e7e494/AUD8-0001-1_Leighton-D_Exterior-01-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nThink of European farmhouse as modern farmhouse’s more sophisticated counterpart. European farmhouse style is defined by warmth, layers and a timeless feel.\n\n“Some of the basic farmhouse elements are still prevalent, like some board and batten, clean lines, and steep roof pitches, but incorporate materials like textured brick, more stone, and natural cedar,” Alexa said.\n\n![custom home with stone and board and batten exterior](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/d75e7c2a-8dc9-4a1f-91ff-0a1304df4d0d/FFC-0002-1_Eastland-II-F_Exterior-1-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Design your dream home today!\n\nFrom [Pantone’s Color of the Year,](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2025?gad_source=1) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dreeshomes/) inspiration and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/) pins all the way to your final floor plan, Drees makes it easy to bring it all together.

Design experts from [Architectural Digest](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/interior-design-trends-2025) are forecasting earth tones to take over in the new year, expecting people to choose [warmer and deeper colors](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/interior-design-trends-2025) in 2025.\n\n#### Show-stopping appliances\n\n![new Drees home modern kitchen with gold hardware](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/6c67cc13-241c-4bde-9fee-831eb138fdc7/CLTR-0017-K_Lynmar-II-B_Kitchen-05-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nHot in the kitchen in the new year: Top-of-the-line, statement making appliances.\n\nOur homeowners desire cookware that are not only versatile, but beautiful. The modern day appliance must enhance the overall design of the kitchen. Functionality is not enough.\n\n![custom kitchen with stainless steel gas range](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4da9c998-2fc0-48ca-b6cc-5f033ea27d37/KCH-1226-00_Elmsdale-B_Kitchen_6-jpg)![Kitchen Aid six burner gas cooktop](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/9baabcb0-55a9-41e5-93fc-6b26573a1247/OSC-0001-00_Bedford-E_Kitchen_004-tif)\n\n﻿\n\n“We are witnessing a surge in demand for appliances that not only bring culinary expertise to your fingertips and handle multiple cooking tasks (hello, built-in air-fry!), but also enhance the kitchen’s design, making a statement rather than blending into the background,” Alexa said.\n\n#### Vintage-inspired design\n\n![family room with contemporary fireplace](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/229e6a34-083c-47d3-89a1-d3c673fb452a/TRAP-0377-00_Kenai-B_family2-tif)\n\n﻿\n\nHomeowners are finding comfort in familiar finishes and furnishings that nod to the past. Adding vintage-inspired or nostalgic colors - think olive greens, rust oranges, mustard yellows and rich browns - playful patterns and designs can create a cozy reprieve from the hustle and bustle of modern-day life.\n\n“Think warm colors, stained wood, artisan tiles with imperfect texture and detailed embellishments in lighting and plumbing fixtures,” Alexa said.\n\n[Nashville's](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f06e405acffb463b97cc72afbf047902.aspx?view=neighborhoods) newest [Elmsdale model](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/30349bb6c8a04489a0951bdec42a3555.aspx) at [Kings' Chapel](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/521b35027a2f490d962fb53a6991899f.aspx?mapState=false&view=floorplans) showcases this beautifully. The [Elmsdale's](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/30349bb6c8a04489a0951bdec42a3555.aspx) family room features rustic, wooden beams and a colonial-style chandelier.\n\n![open concept family room and kitchen](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/7b130303-eb76-4a74-b17e-61903f896647/KCH-1226-00_Elmsdale-B_FamilyRoom_4-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n[Pantone’s Color of the Year](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f552d987c98a48ffb234afb03a03188f.aspx) is in line with vintage-inspired design. [Mocha Mousse,](https://www.dreeshomes.com/link/f552d987c98a48ffb234afb03a03188f.aspx) a warming, brown hue imbued with richness, will be a popular shade in 2025. This brown/pink shade proves that brown is back for home design choices, from paint to furntiture to wall decor. Expect to see Pantone's Mocha Mousse (or at least a variation of it) and lots of earth tones in the home this year.\n\n#### More is more!\n\n![Primary Suite with tray ceiling and wainscoting](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/41918d16-3c61-454b-8c38-a25fd7fcf094/WRSF-0022-A_Brady-A_Primary-Suite-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nMaximalism is in vogue. This trend is the intersection of color, pattern and drama. Expect color and bold patterns in tile, cabinetry and other finishes.\n\nThis year will be all about infusing individuality into the home, and this means that safe shades will be cast aside. Homeowners are more apt to select colors and finishes that were considered too permanent to take a risk on in previous years. Alexa’s advice: If you love it now, chances are you’ll love it for years to come.\n\n![family room with contemporary fireplace](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/dd8ebbf0-1b2c-4e13-abcd-9206b85e2339/AUD7-0006-2_Brookdale-II-B_Family-Room-03jpg-jpg)\n\n![freestanding tub with brass faucet](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/d2b0c231-9484-4eb6-b334-01bebff15b17/AUD7-0006-2_Brookdale-II-B_Primary-Bath-05-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n“Less home buyers today are concerned with how their home design will affect resale value and more interested in how their interiors and surroundings will spark their own happiness,” Alexa said.\n\nSimilarly, [Architectural Digest](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/interior-design-trends-2025) is predicting homeowners will be all about real personality and [embracing immersive interiors](https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/interior-design-trends-2025) \\- mixing patterns, using floor-to-ceiling color and incorporating bold art and decor.\n\n#### European farmhouse exteriors\n\n![Drees custom home with cozy front porch](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/4ab17c0f-ad75-46a5-a047-ace9f5e7e494/AUD8-0001-1_Leighton-D_Exterior-01-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\nThink of European farmhouse as modern farmhouse’s more sophisticated counterpart. European farmhouse style is defined by warmth, layers and a timeless feel.\n\n“Some of the basic farmhouse elements are still prevalent, like some board and batten, clean lines, and steep roof pitches, but incorporate materials like textured brick, more stone, and natural cedar,” Alexa said.\n\n![custom home with stone and board and batten exterior](https://assetcloud.dreeshomes.com/transform/d75e7c2a-8dc9-4a1f-91ff-0a1304df4d0d/FFC-0002-1_Eastland-II-F_Exterior-1-jpg)\n\n﻿\n\n#### Design your dream home today!\n\nFrom [Pantone’s Color of the Year,](https://www.pantone.com/color-of-the-year/2025?gad_source=1) [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/dreeshomes/) inspiration and [Pinterest](https://www.pinterest.com/dreeshomes/) pins all the way to your final floor plan, Drees makes it easy to bring it all together.
